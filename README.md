## 🚨 Rules to Live By

✅ **DO:**
- Struggle for 30 mins before checking solutions
- Always analyze time/space complexity
- Review problems after 1 week and 1 month
- Commit daily (even 1 problem = green square)
- Take 1 full day off per week

❌ **DON'T:**

- Give up too fast
- Skip easy problems
- Ignore fundamentals
- Burn out (rest is productive!)
